# The centralizer of a transitive group of permutations

A permutation commuting with every element of a transitive group of permutations, and fixing one
letter, is the identity: transitivity carries the fixed letter to any other letter, and the
commutation then makes the permutation fix that letter too. So the centralizer of a transitive
group of permutations, acting on the letters by evaluation, has trivial stabilizers, and its order
divides the number of letters.

This bounds the size of the centralizer of a transitive permutation group, which is the
semiregularity step behind the order bound for the automorphism group of a permutation group
action.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.eq_one_of_mem_centralizer_of_apply_eq`: a commuting permutation fixing a letter is the
  identity.
* `Subgroup.centralizer_stabilizer_eq_bot`: the centralizer of a transitive group of permutations
  acts freely on the letters.
* `Subgroup.card_centralizer_dvd`: the order of that centralizer divides the number of letters.

The counting step is Mathlib's `MulAction.selfEquivOrbitsQuotientProd`, which exhibits a set with
trivial stabilizers as the product of its orbit space with the acting group.
